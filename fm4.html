  <h2>Farmers  Right for Benefit Shar it Sharing</h2>
  <p>Earlier sections have highlighted the important role of farmers’ varieties for breeding
new plant varieties. Usually one or more farmers’ varieties or their derivatives are
used as parents to breed new varieties. These farmers’ varieties could be traced to
have been contributed by one or more farming or tribal communities. It is also
possible that the new variety that is registered under the Act has become popular
among farmers. But because it is registered, its PBR-holder alone is entitled to
commercially produce and market its seed. The popularity and exclusive marketing
right may lead to huge seed sale and profits to the PBR-holder. The Act provides for
equitable sharing of the benefit earned from the new variety with farming or tribal
communities that had contributed varieties used as parents [see Annexure 2, Section
26 (5)].
BOX 4:
GENDER EQUITY ON FARMERS’
RIGHTS - Agriculture in India is
essentially a family enterprise, whether
land owned or landless. Women and
men are equally involved in various
agricultural operations, from seed
selection, planting, husbanding
the crop, harvesting, marketing,
processing and to cooking and
consumption with gender-based skills
and roles. The farming traditions and
social norms have leveraged women to
evolve and conserve a large body of
traditional knowledge on crop
varieties and in exercising their choice
to meet household food and
nutritional security. This critical role of
women is, often not recognized by law
and policy makers and development
planners. Hence, despite their
important role in agriculture, women
are denied fair deal in resources such
as land, credit, agriculture inputs,
technology and training services.
Hence, mainstreaming gender equity
on farmers’ rights is advocated by
MSSRF. One of these advocacies is
inclusion of name of wife in the
application, whenever male farmer is
registering a variety developed at their
farm.
Chapter 4: The Nine Rights of Farmers 21
22 Manual on Farmers’ Rights
Normally, all applicants who seek to register new varieties are required to declare the
source of the varieties used as parents for breeding new varieties [see Annexure 2,
Section 18 (e), (h)]. Farmers are given
opportunity to submit claims for benefit
share, when their variety is used as parents
[see Annexure 2, Section 26 (2)]. Claims
for benefit share is made when breeder
discloses the use of specific varieties
conserved by farmers of a region or on the
basis of strong grounds which may
substantiate undisclosed use of specific
farmers’ variety by the breeder. Claims for
benefit share has to be made in Form PV-7
(see Annexure 2, page 73) prescribed by the
Authority within six months from the date
of advertisement inviting such claims by
the Authority. On examination of such
claims by the Authority applicant eligible
for benefit sharing and the quantum of
benefit to be shared are decided. The PBRholder
of the variety is required to remit
the awarded benefit share in the National
Gene Fund [see Annexure 2, Section 26 (6)]. The benefit share may be disbursed
from the National Gene Fund to the eligible individual, community or institution
[see Annexure 2, Section 45 (2) (a)].
Therefore for claiming eligible benefit share, the farming communities shoul</p>
